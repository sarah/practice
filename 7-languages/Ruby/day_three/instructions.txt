Modify the CSV application to support an each method to return a CsvRow object. 

Use method_missing on that CsvRow to return the value for the column for a given heading. 

For example, for the file:
one, two
lions, tigers
bears, people

build an API that works like this:

csv = RubyCsv.new csv.each {|row| puts row.one}

and gives the following output:

"lions"
"bears"

And if you asked for the row with the heading of "two": 

csv = RubyCsv.new csv.each {|row| puts row.two}

you'd get the following output:

"tigers"
"people"
