What is this? Me going through code tutorials in new and existing languages.

Often I do this stuff in the morning as learning / warm-up / practice / play. 
I'm finding a lot of delight in simply doing code-exercises separate from work and requirements. 

I'm currently going through the K&R learning C and also 7 languages in 7 weeks, which is a great book that I highly recommend.
